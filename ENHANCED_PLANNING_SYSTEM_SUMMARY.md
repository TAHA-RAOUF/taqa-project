# Enhanced Planning System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully redesigned and enhanced the planning/maintenance scheduling UI with a focus on better user experience, interactive elements, and sophisticated data visualization with algorithm implementation.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Planning Algorithm
- **Weighted Shortest Processing Time with Multiple Constraints**
- **Efficiency Ratio Calculation**: Urgency Score / Processing Time
- **Multi-factor optimization**:
  - Criticality weights (Critical: 10, High: 7, Medium: 4, Low: 1)
  - Equipment factor multiplier (1.2x for equipment-specific anomalies)
  - Utilization targeting (85% optimal)
  - Balance scoring for criticality diversity

### 2. Enhanced Window Detail Modal (`WindowDetailModal.tsx`)
- **Interactive Design**: Smooth animations and modern UI
- **Enhanced Header**: Gradient background with contextual information
- **Visual Statistics**: Progress bars, metrics cards, and criticality breakdown
- **Real-time Utilization**: Color-coded progress indicators
- **Improved Edit Mode**: Clear visual distinction with guidance

### 3. New Calendar Planning View (`CalendarPlanningView.tsx`)
- **Multiple Calendar Views**: Month, Week, and Timeline views
- **Interactive Calendar Grid**: Click to create windows, view details inline
- **Visual Window Display**: Color-coded by type and risk level with utilization bars
- **Drag-and-Drop Ready**: Foundation for direct window manipulation
- **Time-based Planning**: Hour-by-hour scheduling in week view
- **Smart Date Navigation**: Easy month/week navigation with "Today" quick access
- **Window Overlap Detection**: Visual indicators for scheduling conflicts

### 4. Algorithm Visualization Tab
- **Real-time Algorithm Display**: Shows how the algorithm works
- **Sorted Anomalies**: By calculated efficiency ratio
- **Window Analysis**: Detailed metrics for each window
- **AI Recommendations**: Automatic suggestions based on algorithm analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Overall system efficiency tracking

### 5. Improved User Experience
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and keyframes
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, loading states
- **Visual Feedback**: Color coding, progress bars, badges
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Components
```typescript
// Efficiency calculation
efficiency = urgencyScore / processingTime

// Urgency scoring
urgencyScore = criticalityWeight * equipmentFactor

// Utilization calculation
utilization = (totalWorkDays / windowCapacity) * 100

// Risk assessment
riskLevel = utilization > 100 ? 'high' : 
           utilization > 85 ? 'medium' : 
           hasCriticalAnomalies ? 'medium' : 'low'
```

### Data Flow
1. **Raw Data**: Anomalies, Windows, Action Plans
2. **Algorithm Processing**: Sorting, scoring, optimization
3. **Analytics Generation**: Statistics, recommendations
4. **UI Rendering**: Interactive components, visualizations
5. **User Actions**: Create, edit, view, optimize
